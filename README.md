This example demonstrates a common error in Ada: division by zero.  The code includes an `if` statement to check if the divisor is zero before performing the division.  However, a more robust approach is to use Ada's exception handling mechanism to catch potential runtime errors.  The solution demonstrates this improved approach.  The `when others` clause catches all exceptions, providing a general error handler.
